EDGE DETECTION
Lx= -1/2 0 1/2
   1/2
Ly= 0
   -1/2
Multiply with pixel value, use the formula:
Use L=sqrt(Lx^2+Ly^2)
L is the pixel value.

CANNY FILTER
Also used for edge detection. Thinner edges.
Colour --> Grayscale -->Gaussian filter --> Sobel filter -->Non-maximum suppression
Calculate:
Theta=tan-1(Gy/Gx) --> round off to 0,45,90,135
theta is the direction.Compare in neighbourhood of pixel based on the matrix given below.If pixel intensity is lower than the neighouring values, set pixel intensity to 0.
135 90 45
0   .  0
45 90 135
